Hi, I am looking for a job opportunity in Data Science, preferably in AI Research. I am a 2015 Mathematics graduate from IIT Kanpur, also hhaving a pre-doctoral degree in Computer Science from KU Leuven, Belgium.

Over the last 3 years, I was a PhD candidate with [Prof. Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt/) as part of the [SYNTH Project](https://synth.cs.kuleuven.be) on 'Automating Data Science' in the research group of [Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence (DTAI)](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/), Belgium.

My work was themed around '<strong>Logic and Learning in Automating Data Science</strong>' with a prime focus on probabilistic logic programming, rule learning, predicate invention and planning.
