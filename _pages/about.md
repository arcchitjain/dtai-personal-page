Hi, I am a PhD student with <a href="https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt/" target="_blank">Prof. Luc De Raedt</a> as part of the <a href="https://synth.cs.kuleuven.be" target="_blank">SYNTH Project</a> in the research group of <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence (DTAI)</a> at KU Leuven, Belgium.

My PhD is themed around <strong>Logic and Learning in Automating Data Science</strong> with a prime focus on probabilistic logic programming, rule learning, predicate invention and planning.

I have previously worked on Credit Risk Management at <strong>American Express</strong> for 2 years after graduating with an MSc Integrated degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from <strong>Indian Intitute of Technology, Kanpur</strong>, India in 2015.
